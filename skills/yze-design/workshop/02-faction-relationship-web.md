## 1. Origin — how this was built

- **Source primitives:** **P14 (encounter engine with memory)** + **P4 (typed D66)** + a domain transfer of **P10 (protected dial, inverted)** for the bond tracks.
- **Reinvention operator:** **Fusion + Domain Transfer.** Fuse P14 (world-with-memory) with P4 (typed consequence) to model relationship *events*. Domain-transfer P10: a bond between two factions is a track that grows when cultivated and shrinks when stressed — like Pride, but bidirectional and shared.
- **Target psychology:** **Investment + entanglement** — a web the PCs cannot escape. Every action helps one faction and hurts another; neutrality is a position with costs.
- **Problem solved:** most RPG faction systems track "standing with Faction X" as an isolated number, producing siloed reputation grind. This module makes the *edges between factions* as tracked as the nodes — so helping A propagates through A's alliances to warm A's allies and chill A's enemies.

## 2. The generic design space

### 2a. Mechanism overview

A campaign has 3–7 factions. Each pair has a relationship scored on two axes: **Bond** (emotional/practical, −5 to +5) and **Debt** (directional, −3 to +3). The party has a **Standing** (−5 to +5) with each faction. When the party's Standing with A changes, it **propagates** through A's bonds to shift the party's Standing with A's allies and enemies. At each downtime, a D66 **Relationship Event** rolls to shift the graph under the party. Factions owed debts can **call them in** — the web's primary pressure valve.

### 2b. NEW CONCEPTS introduced

- **NEW CONCEPT — Propagation rule:** No core engine system propagates a standing change through a relationship graph. The propagation formula (§2c) makes the party's reputation with each faction a *function of its reputation with that faction's allies and enemies.* *Extends the engine by making reputation relational rather than siloed.*
- **NEW CONCEPT — Bidirectional Bond track:** Core reputation is a single party→faction vector. A Bond is a *faction↔faction* edge, tracked separately from the party's standing with either. *Extends the engine by adding a second layer of tracked relationship (between NPCs/factions, not just party↔faction).*
- **NEW CONCEPT — Directional Debt:** Debts are asymmetric (A owes B ≠ B owes A) and *callable* — a creditor can pull a future obligation. *Extends the engine by introducing a deferred-obligation mechanism with a defined call procedure (§2c).*

### 2c. Mechanical reference (tables & procedures)

#### The graph

Track on a grid: factions on both axes. Upper triangle = Bond (−5 to +5). Lower triangle = Debt (−3 to +3, directional: a positive value in cell [A,B] means B owes A). Diagonal = n/a.

#### The party's Standing

Per faction: −5 (hunted) / −3 (enemy) / −1 (distrusted) / 0 (neutral) / +1 (welcome) / +3 (ally) / +5 (blood-pact). Starts at 0 for all unless the campaign specifies otherwise.

#### The propagation formula

When the party's Standing with Faction A changes by **Δ** (positive or negative), every other Faction B shifts its Standing with the party by:

> **ΔStanding_party[B] = floor(Δ × Bond[A,B] / 5)**, rounded toward zero, capped at ±Δ.

Worked examples:
- Party helps A, **Δ = +2**. Faction B has Bond[A,B] = +4 (allies). ΔStanding_party[B] = floor(2 × 4 / 5) = floor(1.6) = **+1**. B warms to the party.
- Same Δ = +2, but Faction C has Bond[A,C] = −3 (enemies). ΔStanding_party[C] = floor(2 × −3 / 5) = floor(−1.2) = **−1**. C cools to the party.
- Faction D has Bond[A,D] = +1 (cordial). ΔStanding_party[D] = floor(2 × 1 / 5) = floor(0.4) = **0**. No shift — the bond is too weak to propagate.

**Propagation does not cascade:** only the *direct* allies/enemies of A shift. A's allies' *other* allies are not affected (this prevents graph-flip and keeps the math bounded). If using the "full propagation" dial (§4), allow one extra hop at half strength.

#### The Relationship Event table (full D66)

At each downtime boundary, roll D66 and apply. Roll twice if the dial is set to "1/session" cadence with a busy campaign.

| D66 | Event | Mechanical effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | **Friction.** Two factions with Bond ≥ +2 bicker over a minor issue. | Bond between them −1. |
| 12 | **Trade dispute.** Two trading partners (Bond ≥ 0) quarrel. | Bond −1; one assumes Debt +1 to the other (unpaid goods). |
| 13 | **Border incident.** Two neighboring factions clash at a margin. | Bond −1; if already ≤ −2, drops to −3. |
| 14 | **Rumor.** A calumny spreads between two factions. | Bond −1; the rumor's source (a third faction) gains +1 Standing with the party if the party planted it. |
| 15 | **Cold shoulder.** One faction snubs another's envoy. | Bond −1; no Debt change. |
| 16 | **Old wound.** A historical grievance resurfaces. | Bond drops to −2 (if higher); if already ≤ −2, no change. |
| 21 | **Cultural exchange.** Two factions share a festival or ritual. | Bond +1. |
| 22 | **Marriage / merger.** Two factions formalize a tie. | Bond +1; one assumes Debt −1 to the other (dowry / merger terms). |
| 23 | **Mutual aid.** Two factions cooperate against a minor threat. | Bond +1. |
| 24 | **Trade boom.** A profitable exchange enriches both. | Bond +1; both gain +1 to their org Strength track (if using `07`). |
| 25 | **Shared victory.** Two factions win a joint operation. | Bond +2. |
| 26 | **Envoy.** A faction sends a respected figure to another. | Bond +1; the envoy's faction gains +1 Standing with the party if the party facilitated. |
| 31 | **Betrayal.** One faction breaks a pact with another. | Bond drops to −3; Debt inverts (if A owed B, now B owes A). |
| 32 | **Assassination.** A faction kills a figure of another. | Bond drops to −4; the victim faction calls its debts (§Debt Call). |
| 33 | **Raid.** One faction raids another's territory. | Bond −2; Debt +1 (the raider owes reparations, unenforced). |
| 34 | **Schism.** A faction splits internally; one half aligns with a rival. | Bond −2 with the rival's enemy; the schismatics' Standing with the party shifts by ±1 (GM: did the party back them?). |
| 35 | **Scandal.** A faction's leader is disgraced. | That faction's Bond with all others −1 for a season; the party's Standing with them −1 if they were allied. |
| 36 | **Defection.** A faction's ally switches sides. | Bond with old ally drops to −3; Bond with new ally +2. |
| 41 | **Shared threat.** A third-party threat aligns two enemies. | Bond +2 (temporary — reverts at next downtime if the threat passes). |
| 42 | **Famine / crisis.** A faction is weakened. | Their org Strength −1; Bond with allies +1 (rallying), Bond with enemies −1 (opportunism). |
| 43 | **Festival.** A multi-faction gathering. | All Bonds present shift +1; the party may roll a Public Act (`workshop/01`) for Influence. |
| 44 | **Election.** A faction's leadership changes. | Roll 1D6: 1–3 new leader is hostile (Bond with party's allies −1); 4–6 neutral/continuity. |
| 45 | **Revelation.** A secret about a faction emerges. | The faction's Standing with the party shifts by ±1 (GM: did the party know?). |
| 46 | **Migration.** A faction moves territory. | Bond with the new neighbors shifts ±1 (GM); Bond with the old neighbors −1. |
| 51 | **Debt called.** A faction calls a Debt owed by another. | Apply the Debt Call procedure (below). |
| 52 | **Debt called (on the party).** A faction calls a Debt the party owes. | The party must pay or refuse (§Debt Call). |
| 53 | **Favor offered.** A faction offers the party a favor — accepting it creates Debt. | Party gains +1 Standing now; gains Debt +1 to that faction. |
| 54 | **Bribe.** A faction offers the party resources to act for them. | Party gains the resource; if accepted, Standing with rival factions propagates −1. |
| 55 | ** Ultimatum.** A faction demands the party choose a side. | Party must shift Standing with one faction +1 and another −1 within the session, or lose +1 Standing with the issuer. |
| 56 | **Summit.** Multiple factions meet; the party may mediate. | Success: Bond between two factions +1, party Standing +1 with both. Failure: Bond −1, party Standing −1 with both. |
| 61 | **War declared.** Two factions enter open war. | Bond drops to −5; both call in debts to the party (§Debt Call). |
| 62 | **Siege.** One faction besieges another's stronghold. | Defender's org Strength −1 per session until relieved; the relieving faction gains Bond +2. |
| 63 | **Revolution.** A faction's underclass rises. | The faction's Bond with all others −1; the party's Standing shifts by ±1 (GM: which side did they back?). |
| 64 | **External invasion.** A new faction (GM-introduced) invades. | All existing factions' Bond with each other +1 (rallying); the party's Standing with the invader starts at −3. |
| 65 | **Collapse.** A faction falls. | Remove it from the graph; its debts are void; its Bond-allies lose 1 Standing with the party (blame); its Bond-enemies gain 1. |
| 66 | **Coronation / ascension.** A faction achieves dominance. | That faction's Bond with all others shifts to +2 (fealty) or −2 (defiance) by GM call; the party's Standing with them becomes the campaign's central tension. |

#### The Debt Call procedure

1. **When:** a faction (the creditor) with Debt ≥ +1 over the party (or over another faction the party needs) declares the call. This is a GM action, not a roll — the creditor *decides* to pull the obligation.
2. **The demand:** the creditor names what they want — a service, a vote, a non-aggression pact, a resource, access. The demand must be *proportionate* to the Debt (Debt +1 = a small favor; Debt +3 = a major ask).
3. **The party's options:**
   - **Pay:** perform the demand. The Debt steps down by 1 (or to 0 if the demand was major and the Debt was +1). Standing with the creditor +1 (good faith).
   - **Refuse:** the Debt is *voided* (you broke the obligation), but the creditor's Standing with the party drops to −3 and propagates: the creditor's Bond-allies drop the party by −1 each. You have made an enemy.
   - **Renegotiate:** roll a social conflict (`03 §11`) or Social Combat (`workshop/03`). Success converts the Debt to a smaller one or a different form; failure doubles it.
4. **Limit:** a faction may call at most one Debt per session. This prevents debt-spam (§6).

## 3. The pressure loop

- **Pressure:** standing propagates; debts come due; relationship events shift the graph.
- **Decision:** *help A (anger A's enemies) or stay neutral (gain nothing)? pay the called debt or refuse (make an enemy)?*
- **Consequence:** the graph shifts; doors open and close; debts shuffle.
- **State change:** the campaign's political landscape is a living thing the PCs steered.
- **Loop shape:** **act → propagate → debt/event → realign → act.** Session/season cadence.

## 4. Dials

| Dial | Setting A | Setting B | Psychology |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Faction count** | 3–4 (manageable) | 6–7 (dense web) | Clear choices vs rich entanglement |
| **Propagation strength** | Half (formula as written) | Full (×2 before rounding) + 1 extra hop at half | Volatile vs stable |
| **Event frequency** | 1/session | 1/season | Constant churn vs strategic pacing |
| **Debt call initiator** | GM-driven (creditor decides) | Symmetric (party can call debts owed *to them*) | Pressure vs agency |
| **Standing range** | −5/+5 (wide) | −3/+3 (tight) | Deep feuds vs quick shifts |
| **Neutrality** | Allowed (no-op) | Costly (neutral party loses Standing with all sides each session) | Safe middle vs forced alignment |

**Default:** 4 factions, half propagation, 1 event/session, GM-driven calls, wide range, neutrality allowed.

## 5. Integration points

- **Hooks into:** org layer (`07`) — factions *are* orgs (P7 lifecycle); their Bond/Debt are the org's "events" beat. Influence module (`workshop/01`) — PC Influence is faction-specific. Encounter tables (`09 §4`) — high-standing factions send allies; low-standing send assassins. Campaign-state tracker (`09 §8`).
- **Requires:** 3–7 named factions with defined initial Bonds/Debts. Define the graph *before* play.
- **Replaces / extends:** flat Reputation trackers — adds the relational dimension.
- **Cross-refs:** `07` (org lifecycle, faction turn), `09` (campaign-state trackers), `12` (faction divergence cluster).

## 6. Failure modes & edge cases

- **Graph explosion.** 7 factions = 21 edges × 2 = 42 numbers. **Fix:** cap at 4–5; abstract minor factions into a regional modifier.
- **Propagation cascade.** Full propagation + wide range can flip the graph in a session. **Fix:** half propagation (default); cap single-action Standing shifts at ±2.
- **The irrelevance trap.** If the party can ignore factions cost-free, the web is scenery. **Fix:** tie something the party *needs* to each faction.
- **Debt amnesia.** If debts are never called, they're bookkeeping. **Fix:** roll on the event table each session — rows 51–52 force a call; the GM should call at least one debt per session otherwise.
- **Neutrality dominance.** If neutrality is free and safe, rational players never take sides. **Fix:** the costly-neutrality dial, or make every session's event demand a response.

## 7. Validation notes

- **Math:** propagation is bounded by Bond range (±5); worst-case single action propagates ±Δ through direct edges only. With 4 factions, max cascade depth is 1 hop (no cascade by default). The formula's `/5` divisor ensures weak bonds (±1) rarely propagate — only strong relationships (±3+) reliably shift the party's standing elsewhere.
- **Exploits (`13 §5`):** **debt-farming** (party calls every debt owed to them in one session). Gated by the one-call-per-session-per-faction limit. **Propagation-engineering** (party helps A specifically to anger A's enemy B, then helps B to anger A) — this is *intended* play (the web's cross-pressure), not an exploit, but if it becomes a treadmill, add the costly-neutrality dial.
- **Felt experience (`19`):** propagation makes the world *feel reactive* (C5). Cognitive load (FE2) is the cost — cap factions to control it. Costly neutrality produces strong forced-choice feel (good for political genres, exhausting for others).

## 8. Worked genre example — Post-apoc warlords

**Setting:** irradiated ruins, three generations after the fall. Four warlords contest a river valley: **The Pale Banner** (zealot ex-soldiers), **The Coil** (tech-scavenger cartel), **The Long Grass** (nomad clan-riders), **The Concrete Commune** (fortified town-dwellers).

**Initial graph:**
- Pale Banner ↔ Long Grass: Bond −3 (ideological hatred). Debt 0.
- Pale Banner ↔ Concrete Commune: Bond +1 (mutual defense pact). Debt +2 (Commune owes Banner — broke a pact).
- Coil ↔ Concrete Commune: Bond +2 (trade partners). Debt −1 (Coil owes Commune a shipment).
- Coil ↔ Long Grass: Bond 0 (neutral). Debt 0.
- Pale Banner ↔ Coil: Bond −2 (Banner hates Coil's tech-worship). Debt 0.

**Party starts:** Standing 0 with all four.

**In use:**

- **Session 1.** Party brokers a water-purifier repair for the Commune (Coil tech, Commune labor). Coil likes this — party Standing with Coil +2. **Propagation:** Pale Banner (Bond[Coil,Banner] = −2) → ΔStanding_party[Banner] = floor(2 × −2 / 5) = floor(−0.8) = **−1**. Commune (Bond[Coil,Commune] = +2) → floor(2 × 2 / 5) = floor(0.8) = **0** (too weak to propagate). Party is now: Coil +2, Commune 0, Long Grass 0, Banner −1.
- **Session 3.** Party escorts a Long Grass bride-exchange across Banner territory — a risky diplomatic act. Standing with Long Grass +3. **Propagation:** Banner (Bond[LongGrass,Banner] = −3) → floor(3 × −3 / 5) = floor(−1.8) = **−2**. Party Banner Standing: −1 → −3. The Banner's preacher declares them *apostates.*
- **Session 5.** Downtime event roll: **51 (Debt called).** The Pale Banner calls the Commune's Debt (+2): "Honor our pact — deny these apostate drifters your water, or we abrogate the defense pact." The Commune must choose (the GM plays the Commune). The party must either repair the Commune-Banner Bond (how?) or accept that the Commune will turn on them. The graph is exerting force.

**Why post-apoc:** the web models warlord politics — *you cannot be friends with everyone because they hate each other.* Propagation makes every choice a commitment. Called debts make past favors into current traps.

**Re-skin:**
- **Court intrigue:** factions = Noble Houses; Bonds = marriages/feuds; Debts = treaties/oaths; events = royal marriages, assassinations.
- **Corporate:** factions = Megacorps; Bonds = partnerships/competition; Debts = contracts; events = mergers, hostile takeovers.
- **Colony/revolutionary:** factions = Moderates / Radicals / Foreign backers / Crown; events = regime crises.
- **Greek city-states:** factions = Poleis; Bonds = league alignments; Debts = tribute; events = Persian invasions reshaping all alignments.

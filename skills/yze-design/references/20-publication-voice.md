# Publication Voice — From Designer Jargon to Player Prose

> **STATUS: FILLED.** This is the skill's **voice layer** — the translation bridge between the designer/AI vocabulary used inside `yze-design` (pressure loops, friction levers, deltas, propagation formulas, abstraction ladders) and the publication-ready prose a player or Gamemaster actually reads. Load this file whenever you are writing text that will be read by the audience below — rulebook chapters, talent descriptions, adventure text, GM guidance, examples of play. Do not load it for internal design notes, skill files, or private outlines.

## 1. Why this file exists

`yze-design` thinks in a dense internal vocabulary — *pressure loops, friction levers, deltas, propagation rules, abstraction ladders, dual-use matrices, felt-experience failure modes, the org lifecycle.* This vocabulary is necessary for precision when *designing*. It is poison when *publishing*. A player or GM reading a rulebook does not want to learn a design theory; they want to learn the rule and get back to the table.

This file is the translation layer. It does three things:

1. **Defines the audience** and their reading level.
2. **Gives a dictionary** mapping the skill's internal jargon to plain player-facing prose.
3. **Gives rules and worked examples** for writing publication text that a player can run without a design degree.

This file does **not** teach literary prose style. For fiction voice, period diction, anti-AI humanizing, and genre tone, use the sibling writing skills (`forbidden-lands-writing-voice`, `western-writing`). This file teaches *register* — the difference between talking to a designer and talking to a player.

## 2. The audience

**Who they are:**
- **Ages 18–33.** Mostly millennials and older Gen Z.
- **Gamemasters and players**, not game designers. They may have design opinions, but they do not design for a living and they do not read design theory for fun.
- **Familiar with modern TTRPG culture.** They have read *D&D 5e*, maybe *Pathfinder 2e*, probably one PbtA game, maybe *Blades in the Dark*, possibly a Free League game. They know what a "roll" is, what a "check" is, what "advantage" means.
- **Comfortable with some jargon** that has crossed into mainstream play culture (see §6, the OK-list). They are not comfortable with design-theory jargon or academic/AI vocabulary.
- **Reading to play, not to study.** They want to understand the rule, make a decision, and move on. They will not re-read a paragraph to unpack it.

**Who they are NOT:**
- Not game designers. Do not assume they know what a "pressure economy" or a "design dial" is.
- Not AI. Do not write in the bullet-heavy, abstracted, framework-driven register this skill uses internally. That register is for design precision; it is not how humans talk to each other about games.
- Not academics. Avoid mathematical notation (Δ, formulas), scientific phrasing ("calibrates," "instantiates," "parameters"), and structuralist vocabulary ("taxonomy," "instantiation," "matrix" outside its common RPG sense).

**The test:** would a 24-year-old who has run a year of *D&D* and just bought this book understand this sentence on the first read, without a dictionary? If yes, ship it. If no, rewrite it.

## 3. The core principle — two registers, never mixed

This skill operates in two registers. They must never appear in the same document.

| | **Design register** (internal) | **Publication register** (player-facing) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Where** | Skill files, design notes, outlines, private analysis | Rulebook chapters, talent descriptions, adventure text, GM guidance, examples of play |
| **Vocabulary** | Pressure loops, deltas, propagation, friction levers, abstraction ladders, dials, primitives | Roll, check, bonus, penalty, consequence, stake, risk, cost, effect |
| **Tone** | Analytical, precise, framework-driven | Plain, direct, confident, instructive |
| **Sentence shape** | Long, nested, qualified ("the propagation rule shifts the party's standing with B by a fraction of Δ") | Short, active, concrete ("help the Guild and the Cartel notices") |

**The rule:** when you cross from designing to writing-for-publication, switch register entirely. Do not "dumb down" the design register — *replace* it with the publication register. A player is not a designer who knows less; they are a different reader with different needs.

## 4. The dictionary — designer/AI jargon → player prose

The left column is the vocabulary this skill (and AI design reasoning generally) uses internally. The right column is what to write in published text.

## 5. The blacklist — words to never use in published text

These are the AI/design-theory tells. If you find any of these in publication text, rewrite.

- **pressure loop, pressure economy, pressure source** — describe the consequence, not the loop
- **friction, friction lever** — cost, risk, drawback
- **delta, Δ** — change, shift, gain, loss
- **calibrate, calibration** — set, choose, adjust
- **instantiate, instantiation** — set up, example, version
- **parameter** — choice, option, setting (or just name the thing)
- **taxonomy, taxonomy of** — list, breakdown, kinds of
- **matrix** (in the design sense — a 2D table of options) — table, grid (note: "matrix" is fine if the game itself calls something a matrix)
- **primitive** (as a noun) — never; these are internal labels
- **abstraction ladder, reinvention operator, domain transfer, inversion, fusion, abstraction-climb** — never; internal only
- **dual-use** — never
- **generic mechanism** — the rule, how it works
- **org lifecycle, five-beat lifecycle** — never; describe the steps
- **propagation** (as a noun) — "helping them makes their enemies notice you"
- **attrition curve, breakpoint** — describe the consequence at the threshold
- **felt experience, flow channel, loss aversion, agency ledger** — never; these are psychology-theory terms
- **validation pipeline, warning signs, anti-patterns** — never; internal review only
- **dialectic, heuristic, ontology, epistemic** — never; academic
- **paradigm, synergy, leverage** (as a verb) — corporate-speak
- **moreover, furthermore, additionally, it should be noted that** — AI transition padding; use plain "and," "but," or just start the sentence
- **it is important to note that, it is worth considering** — AI throat-clearing; delete and say the thing
- **in order to** — just "to"
- **utilize** — use
- **facilitate** — help, allow, make possible
- **demonstrate** — show
- **subsequently** — then, next
- **consequently** — so
- **leverage** (as a noun, outside the Social Combat module where it's a game term) — use, advantage, edge

## 6. The OK-list — technical terms players already know

These are fine in publication text because modern TTRPG players know them. Don't over-explain.

- **roll, check, dice pool, D6, D66** — universal
- **success, failure, critical** — universal
- **bonus, penalty, modifier** — universal
- **advantage, disadvantage** — common (5e)
- **tag** — common (PbtA, FitD)
- **clock, countdown** — common (FitD, PbtA) — *the user confirmed this one is OK as flavor*
- **track, progress track** — common (PbtA, FitD)
- **arc** — common (narrative games)
- **scene, session** — universal
- **NPC, PC, GM** — universal
- **tick, step** (as in "tick a clock," "step a die down") — common
- **trigger, move** — common (PbtA)
- **consequence, cost, stake, risk** — universal
- **broken, shaken, exhausted** (as condition names) — common
- **rank, tier, level** — universal
- **hex, pointcrawl** — common (OSR, Free League)
- **Quarter Day, Shift** (as time-block names) — fine if the game defines them
- **Willpower, Faith** (as metacurrency names) — fine if the game uses them
- **lever** (as in "leverage," the Social Combat game term) — fine *only* inside that module's text

## 7. The six register rules

1. **Write to the player, not about the system.** "When you push a roll, you take damage" — not "the push-cost model extracts a bane-self-harm cost from the acting character." The player is the subject; the rule is what happens to them.

2. **Use the game's nouns, not the engine's nouns.** If the game calls it "Willpower," call it Willpower. If it calls it "Faith," call it Faith. Do not call it "the metacurrency" in publication. The game's nouns are the player's nouns.

3. **Show the consequence, not the mechanism.** "Your Influence drops by 1 each session unless you've done something public" — not "the decay valve fires at each downtime boundary, stepping the pool down unless the cultivation test passes." The player needs to know *what happens*, not *why it happens in the design*.

4. **Name the thing, don't theorize it.** "Roll on the Slash table" — not "roll on the typed D66 critical-injury family corresponding to the slash damage type." The table has a name; use it.

5. **Short sentences. Active voice. Concrete nouns.** "You take 1 damage" — not "the character suffers a reduction of one point to the relevant attribute." The publication register is plain English, not academic prose.

6. **Address the reader directly.** "You" is the player or GM. "You roll the dice. You decide whether to push. You take the damage." This is how rulebooks talk. It is not how design documents talk. Switch.

## 8. Worked transformations

Each pair: the design-register sentence (how this skill thinks internally) → the publication-register sentence (what the player reads).

### Engine core

**Design:** "The push-cost model extracts a bane-self-harm cost from the latent cost-face when the player opts to reroll non-success dice."
**Publication:** "When you push a roll, look at the banes (💀) you rolled. Each bane on your attribute dice deals 1 damage to that attribute. Each bane on your gear dice reduces the gear's bonus by 1."

**Design:** "The metacurrency is refueled by the harm-earned loop: 1 WP per bane on Base dice when pushing."
**Publication:** "Every time you push a roll, you gain 1 Willpower for each bane on your attribute dice. Pain fuels your will."

### Character

**Design:** "The attribute-as-HP model routes typed damage to named attributes, with a Broken state at zero."
**Publication:** "Damage reduces your attributes. Take enough Hurts and your Grit hits zero — you're Broken, out of the fight and in danger."

**Design:** "The protected dial is a once-per-session escalating die (D8→D10→D12) wired to character identity, producing peak-moment agency."
**Publication:** "Once per session, after you fail a roll to protect yourself or someone else, you can roll your Pride die and add it to the roll. Pride starts at D12. If you use it and still fail, you lose it next session — it comes back as D8, then grows back to D12 over time if you don't lose it again."

### Conflict

**Design:** "The action economy grants (1 slow + 1 fast) ∨ (2 fast) per Round, with reactions drawn from the same budget."
**Publication:** "On your turn, you can take one slow action and one fast action, or two fast actions. Parrying or dodging is a reaction — it costs a fast action."

**Design:** "A typed D66 critical-injury family is rolled, with the 65/66 climax split producing maim-or-die outcomes."
**Publication:** "Roll D66 on the Slash table. A 65 means you lose a hand. A 66 means you're dead."

### Travel

**Design:** "The activity menu distributes the party's labor across mutually-exclusive demands per time block, producing a coordination-as-tactic pressure."
**Publication:** "Each Quarter Day, everyone picks one job: Hike, Lead the Way, Keep Watch, Forage, Hunt, Make Camp, or Rest. You can only do one. You can't move, navigate, keep watch, and forage at the same time — so split the work."

### Faction web (workshop)

**Design:** "The propagation rule shifts the party's Standing with B by floor(Δ × Bond[A,B] / 5)."
**Publication:** "When you help or anger one faction, the others notice. Help the Guild and the factions that hate the Guild cool on you. Hurt the Guild and its allies warm to you. The stronger the bond between two factions, the bigger the shift."

### Corruption (workshop)

**Design:** "The inverted-step die (P5) grows on benefit-only triggers, with a 3+ result stepping up one tier; at D12 the next 3+ triggers a milestone roll on the tier-gated P4 family."
**Publication:** "Every time you use forbidden power and gain from it, roll your Corruption die. On a 1–2, you got away with it — this time. On a 3 or higher, the die steps up: D6 to D8, D8 to D10, D10 to D12. At D12, the next 3+ means you cross a line — roll on the corruption table to see what you've become."

## 9. The read-aloud test

Before shipping publication text, read it aloud. If:

- **You sound like a textbook** → rewrite in plain English.
- **You sound like a design document** → rewrite addressing "you," the player.
- **A word would need a glossary** → replace it with a plain word or define it inline the first time it appears.
- **A sentence is longer than one breath** → cut it in two.
- **You used a word from the blacklist (§5)** → replace it.
- **The player would ask "what does that mean?"** → rewrite.

The test is simple: **would a 24-year-old who has played D&D understand this on the first read?** If not, rewrite. The goal is not to impress; it is to be understood and get out of the way of play.

## 10. When to defer to the sibling writing skills

This file teaches **register** — the designer-to-player translation. It does not teach:

- **Fiction voice** (prose style, tone, genre diction) → use `forbidden-lands-writing-voice` (FL) or `western-writing` (West).
- **Adventure structure & published-adventure register** → use `adventure-writing` (system-agnostic; its "Published register" section is the companion to this file for adventure text specifically).
- **Game-specific manuscript conventions** (statblock format, chapter structure, example-of-play format) → use `forbidden-lands-design` or `western-rpg-design`.

**The workflow when writing publication text for a YZE game:**
1. Use `yze-design` to design the rule or subsystem.
2. Load **this file** (`20-publication-voice`) to translate the design into publication register.
3. Load the relevant game-specific writing skill (`forbidden-lands-writing-voice` or `western-writing`) for fiction voice and genre tone.
4. Load `adventure-writing` if the text is an adventure (its "Published register" section complements this file).
5. Write. Read aloud (§9). Ship.
